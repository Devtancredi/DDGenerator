DDGenerator is a character statistics generator for introductory games of Dungeons and Dragons. Many new players
are driven off early on by the game's arcane stat calculation and overly diverse selection of races and classes.
DDGenerator allows the user to create a basic character without sacrificing a lot of important character design decisions
so they can get right into a game without being overwhelmed. DDGenerator allows users to create their own character
or let the program create a character for them. DDGenerator also provides brief explanations about the choices
presented to the user through input from pre-made text files to allow a better understanding of the differences
between different choices. DDGenerator allows user input for much of its basic data, such as name and race, but also
allows for the program to randomly generate data using a random number generator that corresponds to different choices.
If the user allows the program to randomly generate data, the program will fetch data corresponding to randomly generated
numbers from text files containing relevent data. Character ability scores are determined through a bounded random number
generator as well, to simulate their calculation through dice rolls, as is done in the real world. All fully generated
characters have the option of having their data bundled and saved to be used at a later date. By the end of the the
program's run time, the user will have created a character to bring to their DM for an introductory game of D&D.
